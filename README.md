The presented standardization pipelines aim to extend Auto-CORPus algorithm (https://github.com/omicsNLP/Auto-CORPus). The developed pipelines allow the processing of files in Microsoft Words, Excel, PowerPoint and PDF formats, and standardize these to text files for automatic information extraction. In addition, text mining pipelines (for tabular data and text) are provided, for SNP entity mining in the standardized files.
